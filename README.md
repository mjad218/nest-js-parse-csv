# Live-Coding-Session 1

Create a project in the specified framework to do the following:

1. Create an api that accepts uploading a csv file, fills a DB Table / Collection  with all records in the file matching the schema of the testing file "names.csv"
2. Create an api that returns an insight showing the count of subscribed people and the count of people who didn't subscribe

PS: Make a consideration for performance, but ignore authentication completely

### Good luck!
